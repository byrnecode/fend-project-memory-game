## How to play

The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match.

Each turn:

- The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
- If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
